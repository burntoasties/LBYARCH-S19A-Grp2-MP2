**x86-C Interface Program - Dot Product**, the kernel is to perform a dot product between vector A and vector B and place the result in *sdot*.\
Scalar variable *n* (integer) contains the length of the vector;  Vectors A and B are both single-precision float. Scalar *sdot* is a single-precision float.\
\
**Process:** $sdot = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \dots + a_n b_n$
